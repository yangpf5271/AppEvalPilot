## Introduction

Welcome to the AppEvalPilot project, a cutting-edge automated evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess software application functionalities across an array of platforms. Tailored for versatility, this framework adeptly handles the evaluation of desktop, mobile, and web-based applications under a unified methodology. 

![Evaluation Process Overview](assets/images/workflow.png)

AppEvalPilot's fully automated process operates without manual intervention, streamlining your workflow while significantly cutting costs. By leveraging our framework, you not only accelerate the evaluation process but also achieve superior accuracy in assessment outcomes. Ideal for developers and QA teams looking to enhance efficiency and quality in their testing procedures, AppEvalPilot stands out as a reliable solution for comprehensive, precise, and efficient application assessments. Join us in advancing software evaluation with AppEvalPilot.

### Features

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: A unified codebase facilitating evaluation across desktop applications, mobile applications, and web-based interfaces.
   
2. **Methodologically Robust Dynamic Assessment**: In contrast to conventional benchmarks employing static evaluation methodologies, AppEvalPilot replicates the systematic workflow of professional testing engineers to conduct thorough application evaluation.
   
3. **Resource Efficiency**: AppEvalPilot completes comprehensive evaluation of 15-20 functional components within an application in approximately 8-9 minutes. The system operates continuously (24/7) to evaluate diverse applications at a cost of $0.26 per app—substantially more economical than human-conducted evaluations.

## Installation

### Windows Setup

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n appeval python=3.10
conda activate appeval

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tanghaom/AppEvalPilot.git
cd AppEvalPilot

# Install dependencies
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install appeval
uv pip install -e .
# Optional: Install enhanced version with OCR and icon detection capabilities
uv pip install -e .[ultra]
```

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) Setup

Only Ubuntu 22.04 with the system-provided Python 3.10 is supported. Use the following commands:

```bash
# System dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-dev python3-tk python3-pip python3-venv python3-pyatspi git gnome-screenshot xclip

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tanghaom/AppEvalPilot.git
cd AppEvalPilot

# Create and activate virtual environment (with system site packages enabled)
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install appeval (editable)
uv pip install -e .
# Optional: Install enhanced version with OCR and icon detection capabilities
uv pip install -e .[ultra]
```

### LLM Configuration

- Edit `config/config2.yaml` to configure your LLM model
- Recommended model: claude-3-5-sonnet-v2
- Ensure appropriate configuration of `api_key` and `base_url` parameters in the configuration file
- For integration of additional multimodal models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B), add the corresponding model identifiers in [`metagpt/provider/constant.py`](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/blob/79390a28247dbfaf8097d3bcd6e6f23b56e9e444/metagpt/provider/constant.py#L34)

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run the main program to execute automated application evaluation
# This will run a single test case on a web application and evaluate its functionality
python main.py
```

```bash
# Run OSagent, which is a powerful GUI-based agent that automates everyday tasks for you - from ordering food delivery and booking rides to searching information and sending it to your contacts.
python scripts/run_osagent.py
```

```bash
# Start the FastAPI task management server, which enables you to:
# - Submit and manage different types of test tasks (URL, Python app, Python Web app)
# - Asynchronously process tasks with status tracking
# - Manage conda environments and processes for application testing
python scripts/server.py
```

```bash
# Launch the Gradio web interface for easy test configuration and execution
# Provides a user-friendly UI to:
# - Configure and run tests on web applications
# - Monitor test execution progress and action history
# - View and analyze test results in real-time
python gradio_app.py
```
